# Problem 1

## Read in NYC Transit data and clean the data

``` r
NYC_transit = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(line:entry, vending, ada) |>
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The NYC Transit dataset contains subway line, station name, station
latitude and longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type,
and ADA compliance.

In my data cleaning process, I first used janitor::clean_names()
function to convert all column names to lowercase. Then I selected the
key factors needed for this analysis. Finally, I transformed the entry
variable from a “YES”/“NO” character format to a logical TRUE/FALSE.

There are 1868 rows and 19 columns for this resulting dataset.
